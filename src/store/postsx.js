    content: `In today's fast-paced digital world, how quickly your website loads isn't just a technical detail—it directly affects your business success. Let's explore why speed matters and how it can impact your bottom line.

## Why Speed Matters (Free Content)

### Customer Expectations

Today's online visitors are impatient. Research shows that:

- Nearly half of all users expect a webpage to load in 2 seconds or less
- 40% will leave a site that takes more than 3 seconds to load
- For every 1-second delay in loading time, you lose 7% of potential sales

### How Speed Affects Sales

Think of your website speed as the digital equivalent of a store's front door:

\`\`\`text
Faster Websites → Better Visitor Experience
              → Visitors Stay Longer
              → More People Buy
\`\`\`

Real-world example: When Walmart made their website faster by just 1 second, they saw a 2% increase in sales.

### Search Engine Rankings

Google and other search engines prefer faster websites. When two websites have similar content, the faster one typically appears higher in search results:

\`\`\`text
Faster Website = Higher in Search Results = More Visitors
\`\`\`

### Mobile Users

Most people now browse on phones rather than computers, and mobile users are even more impatient:

- Over half of mobile users leave websites that take more than 3 seconds to load
- Mobile users are 5 times more likely to leave a slow website

## How Slow Websites Cost You Money

Let's look at a simple example:

\`\`\`text
If your website gets 10,000 visitors per day
And 2% of them make a purchase (200 people)
With an average purchase of $50
Your daily revenue is $10,000

If your site is just 1 second slower:
Only 1.86% make a purchase (186 people)
Your daily revenue drops to $9,300
That's $700 lost every day
Or $255,500 lost every year
\`\`\`

### Customer Loyalty

Speed doesn't just affect immediate sales—it affects whether customers come back:

- 8 out of 10 shoppers who have a bad experience with website speed say they're less likely to buy from that site again
- Nearly half of all users say waiting for pages to load is their biggest frustration when shopping online
